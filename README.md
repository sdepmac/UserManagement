# Overview

## API

The API side is a new API running on .NET 7 with standard CRUD APIs for users. Starting the App locally in visual studio/rider will provide a swagger document for further information.

## GUI

The GUI portion is very closely based off of a react project that I did a few years ago so the tech stack is not what I would have used had I been spending more time on this. I would preferrably be using Typescript (for the type system), Vite (as there are many problems with webpack not least of all the speed at dev time) and perhaps tailwind for a smaller project like this.

To start the gui run

```powershell
 npm install
 
 npm start
 
 ```
